        <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
        <p>I love Renewable energy sources such as biomass, sunlight, water, and wind, which are natural resources and can be converted into clean, usable energy. Renewable energy has positive contribution to the economy, environment, and human health. Homeowners can use clean energy at home by installing renewable energy systems to generate electricity, water and space heating, house cooling amongst others.</p>
